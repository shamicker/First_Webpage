# My First Webpage
## Udacity IPND Project #1

This was my introduction project to HTML and CSS.


## Project Specifications

This is an [example submission](http://codepen.io/AndyAtUdacity/pen/KweNKa?editors=110) that would meet specifications.

You should write your notes that follow the HTML format in the example submission above. Feel free to add extra information and HTML structure as you see fit. These are your personal notes throughout the Nanodegree!

You should reflect on two aspects of your submission: the **code** you've written and the **notes** you've taken about what you've learned.

### 1 - Code Review
Look at the code you've written and reflect on:

- **Use of Syntax**: All of your HTML and CSS should be properly formatted and should pass [HTML validation](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and [CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) tests.

- **Use of Logical HTML Structure**: Content that is logically related should be grouped together within a container element (like a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>).

- **Use of HTML Classes and CSS Styling**: There shouldn't be any unnecessary repetition in your CSS code. Similar HTML elements should have the same class names.

### 2 - Content Review
In addition to looking at the code you write, you should also review your notes to help ensure you have a good understanding of the most important concepts covered so far. Look for:

- **Understanding of Structured Documents**: Your notes should demonstrate an understanding of what it means for computer code to be "structured."

- **The Importance of Avoiding Repetition**: Your notes should contain some explanation of why it's important to avoid repetition when coding.

- **Basic HTML and CSS knowledge**: Consider general use of these two languages and what additional things you may want to incorporate later.

A rubric you can use is included below:
